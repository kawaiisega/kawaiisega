╰(*°▽°*)╯ Hello! \(^ヮ^)/

I'm Saga, a current student who adores cute things! (I think computers are cute..)  Here's a little glimpse into what I do!

- 🌸 Currently blooming and learning HTML/CSS.
- 💖 Absolutely in love with anything cat-related.
- 🎀 Constantly exploring new ideas and technologies!
- 🍰 Enjoying programming to the max!
- 🌈 Fun fact: I lost my old GitHub account password! Consider me 'off-brand' for now.. ✨

Feel free to poke around my repositories and don't be shy to say hi! Let's spread some joy together! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
