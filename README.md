â•°(*Â°â–½Â°*)â•¯ Hello! \(^ãƒ®^)/

I'm Saga, a current student who adores cute things! (I think computers are cute..)  Here's a little glimpse into what I do!

- ðŸŒ¸ Currently blooming and learning HTML/CSS.
- ðŸ’– Absolutely in love with anything cat-related.
- ðŸŽ€ Constantly exploring new ideas and technologies!
- ðŸŒˆ Fun fact: I lost my old GitHub account password! Consider me 'off-brand' for now.. âœ¨

Feel free to poke around my repositories and don't be shy to say hi! (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§
